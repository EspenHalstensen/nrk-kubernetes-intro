## Clean up

You can always look at the pricing for resources [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/nb-no/pricing/calculator/) and your remaining credits by searching for *Free trial* in the portal.

**Delete your cluster** 

Be careful and only delete the cluster we have made during the workshop ðŸ˜‰ 

```
az aks delete --name [CLUSTER NAME] --resource-group [RESOURCE GROUP NAME]
```

**Close your billing account**

Follow the steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription) to close your Azure Subscription. 


And your are done and your credit card will not be charged.

And that's it! âŽˆ
