## Change the code 
We want to change to code to see if it triggers a new build. 

Open the file [backend/data.js](https://github.com/pingrid/nrk-kubernetes-intro/blob/master/backend/data.js) and edit the JSON responses to your name, workplace and education.

If you want, you can also change the background color in [frontend/index.css](https://github.com/pingrid/nrk-kubernetes-intro/blob/master/frontend/src/index.css). 

You can either change the code in an editor or in GitHub directly. Commit and push your commit.

**Then**

Go back to the [Azure pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/) and click on your Recent pipelines to see whether the build starts building. Notice that you can follow the build log if you want to see whats going on during the building of the image.
